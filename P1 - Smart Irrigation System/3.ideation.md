# Ideation

## Idea A: Baseline (Internet-First)
- Soil moisture + temp/humidity sensors → Raspberry Pi
- Time-based relay (8 AM: ON 2 min, 6 PM: ON 2 min)
- Web dashboard (Flask) to view live data and configure times
- Learning wins: sensor wiring, Pi GPIO, web frameworks, networking
- Risks: WiFi dependency; setup complexity; scope creep

## Idea B: Offline-First (Local-Only)
- Same sensors + Raspberry Pi
- 16x2 LCD screen on Pi shows live data + manual override buttons
- Stored schedule (no cloud needed)
- Learning wins: GPIO, Python logic, local state, basic UI
- Risks: No remote access; harder to debug; limited future scalability

## Idea C: Layered Hybrid ⭐ (SELECTED)

### Phase 1: Local Core (Weeks 1–3)
**Goal:** Build and understand the heart of the system offline.

| Component | Role | Why |
|-----------|------|-----|
| **Raspberry Pi 4/3B+** | Brain; runs time-based logic | Python-friendly; GPIO support; enough power |
| **DHT22 (or DHT11)** | Temp + humidity sensor | Cheap; analog + digital options; teaches signal reading |
| **Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor** | Soil moisture + analog reading | Learn ADC conversion; common in hobby projects |
| **5V Relay Module** | Water pump/solenoid control | Learn high-current switching; safe isolation |
| **Breadboard + Jumper Wires** | No soldering; reversible | Alex is hardware-nervous; mistakes are easy to fix |

**Automation Logic:** Python script reads sensors every 5 min; at set times (8 AM, 6 PM), flip relay ON for 2 min.  
**Output:** Print sensor readings to console + optional 16x2 LCD for live display.

### Phase 2: Add Connectivity (Weeks 4–5, optional)
**Goal:** Extend Phase 1 with remote data + schedule control.

| Addition | Role | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Flask Web Server** | Simple dashboard | Alex knows Python; minimal overhead |
| **Sensor Database** | Store readings (SQLite) | Learn basic data persistence |
| **WiFi Module** | Send data to dashboard | Learn networking; keep Phase 1 core working if WiFi fails |

**Fallback:** If WiFi drops, system reverts to Phase 1 logic; no data loss, water still flows.

## Why Hybrid Works for Alex

1. **Confidence building:** Phase 1 is small, tangible, offline—can test immediately without WiFi setup friction
2. **Python leverage:** Alex is comfortable with Python; use that strength to learn hardware logic
3. **Reversible:** If Phase 2 feels like too much, stop at Phase 1; you still have a working system
4. **Scope lock:** Phase 1 = hardware + timer logic; Phase 2 = connectivity only; no feature bloat mid-way
