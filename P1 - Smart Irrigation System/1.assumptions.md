# Assumptions

## Core Assumptions

| # | Assumption | Confidence | Risk Level | Validation |
|----|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Alex can handle basic hardware setup (Raspberry Pi, sensors, relay) without deep embedded experience | Medium | Medium | Start with breadboard + jumper wires (no soldering); test with pre-built sensor modules |
| 2 | Time-based automation is sufficient (no need for soil moisture thresholds yet) | High | Low | MVP uses simple cron/timer; threshold logic can be Phase 2 |
| 3 | Alex wants to *understand* each part, not just plug-and-play | High | Low | Document why each component matters; include learning notes |
| 4 | Monitoring signals (heat/fertilizer) are detectable with cheap sensors (temp, humidity) | Medium | Medium | DHT22 (temp/humidity) widely available; fertilizer = future phase |
| 5 | Dashboard/app doesn't need to be fancy—text/JSON/simple web page is fine | High | Low | Use Flask/Express; render CSV or HTML tables; no React complexity yet |
| 6 | WiFi + internet will be available in Phase 2 (but not required for Phase 1) | High | Low | Design offline-first; internet is additive |
| 7 | Raspberry Pi is the right entry point (vs. Arduino) | Medium | Low | Pi has Python support + GPIO; Arduino would need C/embedded knowledge |

## Learning-Specific Assumptions

- Alex learns best by *doing* (not just reading docs)
- Small, working proof of concept builds confidence
- Understanding *why* wiring matters > getting wiring perfect
