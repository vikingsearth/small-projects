# Problem Statement

## The Problem

**Alex** (hobbyist gardener / student tinkerer) struggles with **manual watering and lack of plant health insight** when **away from home or on a busy schedule** because **forgetting to water leads to dead plants, or over-watering wastes precious resources**. 

Additionally, Alex has **no visibility into plant conditions** (soil moisture, temperature, humidity), so watering decisions are guesses rather than data-driven.

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional:** System automatically waters at set times (e.g., 8 AM for 2 min, 6 PM for 2 min) without manual intervention
2. **Visibility:** Real-time sensor data (soil moisture, temperature, humidity) is accessible locally (LCD screen) or remotely (dashboard)
3. **Learning:** Alex understands how each component (sensor → Pi → relay → water) works and why it matters
4. **Resilience:** System still waters if WiFi drops or dashboard is unavailable (Phase 1 is offline-first)

## Hidden Pain Points

- **Hardware overwhelm:** "Where do I start? Soldering? Breadboards? What's GPIO?"
- **Isolation:** No one to ask when things don't work
- **Scope creep:** Temptation to add ML, mobile app, or fancy features before basics work
