# Next Steps (Action Items)

## Before You Buy Anything: Validation Tasks (This Week)

### Task 1: Research & Learn (2–3 hours)
- Read [Raspberry Pi GPIO Basics](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi-os.html) (official docs; 30 min)
- Watch one beginner GPIO + sensor tutorial on YouTube (pick one with **breadboard, no soldering**; 30 min)
- Skim [DHT22 Python library docs](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT) (15 min)
- Skim [Relay control with Python](https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-relay-control/) (15 min)

**Checkpoint:** Can you draw a rough sketch of: Sensor → Pi → Relay → Water Pump? If yes, move on.

---

### Task 2: Collect Parts List (30 min)
Create a `parts-list.md` with:
- Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB+) or Pi 3B+
- DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor
- Capacitive soil moisture sensor (analog)
- 5V relay module (2-channel)
- Breadboard + jumper wires
- USB power supply for Pi
- Water pump (12V or 5V) + tubing
- Estimated cost (~$40–60)

**Checkpoint:** Share with someone (or just re-read); does it feel reasonable?

---

### Task 3: Sketch Your First Python Script (30 min)
In a file `phase1_prototype.py` (pseudocode, don't run it yet):
```python
# Pseudocode: What will Phase 1 do?
# 1. Read DHT22 every 5 min
# 2. Read soil moisture ADC
# 3. Every day at 8 AM and 6 PM, turn relay on for 2 min
# 4. Log sensor readings to console

import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
import time

# TODO: Setup GPIO pins
# TODO: Read DHT22 via library
# TODO: Schedule watering via cron or APScheduler
# TODO: Print readings
```

**Checkpoint:** Does this map to what you want Phase 1 to do? Adjust if needed.

---

## Phase 1: Build & Test (Weeks 1–3)

### Milestone 1.1: Hardware Assembly (Week 1)
- Receive parts ✓
- Wire DHT22 to Pi on breadboard (3 wires: Vcc, GND, Data)
- Wire soil moisture sensor analog input
- Wire relay control pin to GPIO
- Test each sensor individually with a quick Python script

**Success:** Can read temperature + humidity in your console.

---

### Milestone 1.2: Basic Control (Week 2)
- Write Python script that reads sensors every 5 min
- Manually trigger relay (test pump or buzzer)
- Confirm water actually flows (or relay clicks)

**Success:** Relay turns on/off when you command it.

---

### Milestone 1.3: Scheduled Automation (Week 3)
- Install APScheduler (or cron)
- Build schedule: 8 AM ON (2 min), 6 PM ON (2 min)
- Log all events to a file
- Test for 2–3 days (or simulate time in code)

**Success:** Pump runs at scheduled times without manual input.

---

## Phase 2: Connectivity (Weeks 4–5, Optional)

### Milestone 2.1: Flask Dashboard
- Build minimal Flask app with 2 pages:
  - View: Last 24 hours of sensor data (table or simple graph)
  - Control: Manual override + schedule editor
- Connect to Pi's database (SQLite)

**Success:** Open browser, see today's sensor readings.

---

### Milestone 2.2: WiFi Integration
- Run Flask on Pi; access from another device on same WiFi
- Modify Phase 1 script to log to database (not just console)
- Test: Kill WiFi; confirm Phase 1 still waters

**Success:** "I can check my plants from my laptop!"

---

## Checkpoint: Stop or Continue?

After Phase 1 (end of Week 3):
- **Feel good?** → Move to Phase 2 (dashboard is fun but optional)
- **Overwhelmed?** → Stop here; you have a working system. Take a break. Return later.
- **Want more?** → Phase 2 teaches you web frameworks + databases; go for it.

---

## Resources & Support

- **GPIO confusion?** → Search "Raspberry Pi GPIO [sensor name]" on YouTube; always pick breadboard examples
- **Python library issue?** → Check the GitHub repo's Issues tab; someone has hit it before
- **Relay won't click?** → Check power supply voltage and GPIO pin assignment (most common issues)
- **Stuck?** → Write down exactly what happened, what you expected, and ask in r/raspberry_pi or forums

---

## Learning Wins by Phase

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1–3):**
- ✅ How GPIO pins work (digital in/out)
- ✅ Reading analog sensors via ADC
- ✅ Scheduling logic in Python
- ✅ Relay + high-current switching
- ✅ Building something that actually works

**Phase 2 (Weeks 4–5, optional):**
- ✅ Web frameworks (Flask)
- ✅ Database persistence
- ✅ Networking (WiFi + HTTP)
- ✅ Graceful fallback (offline-first design)
- ✅ "I built an IoT system" confidence

---

## Go Timeframe?
- **Want to start now?** → Order parts today; begin research this week.
- **Prefer a date?** → Pick a start date 1 week out (lets parts arrive); commit to 5–7 hrs/week.

Your move! 🚀
