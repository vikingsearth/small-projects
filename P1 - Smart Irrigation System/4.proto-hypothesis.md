# Proto-Hypotheses

## Hypothesis 1: Hardware Confidence Through No-Solder Setup
**If** we build Phase 1 using only breadboards + jumper wires (no soldering), **then** Alex will complete the hardware assembly without frustration **because** mistakes are cheap to fix, reversible, and don't feel "permanent."

**Validation:**
- Desk research: Find 3–5 beginner Pi + sensor tutorials using breadboards (no soldering)
- Success signal: Alex reports "I wired it in < 2 hours without feeling lost"

---

## Hypothesis 2: Python Code Unlocks Hardware Understanding
**If** we write Phase 1 logic in Python (not C or low-level embedded code), **then** Alex will understand sensor readings + relay control quickly **because** Python is familiar terrain; focus stays on *what* happens, not *how* to syntax.

**Validation:**
- Write a simple 50-line Python script that reads sensors and blinks the relay
- Success signal: Alex can modify the schedule (8 AM → 7 AM) without external help

---

## Hypothesis 3: Offline-First = Confidence + Resilience
**If** Phase 1 works fully offline, **then** Alex will feel confident deploying the system (knowing WiFi failures won't break watering) **because** the core logic is guaranteed.

**Validation:**
- Unplug WiFi during Phase 1 testing; confirm relay still fires on schedule
- Success signal: "My plants will water themselves even if the internet is down"

## Hypothesis 4: Phase 2 Dashboard Unlocks "IoT" Magic
**If** Phase 2 adds a simple Flask web dashboard with real-time sensor graphs, **then** Alex will feel they've built a "real IoT system" **because** remote data access is the tangible difference between "automated" and "smart."

**Validation:**
- Build minimal dashboard: show last 24 hours of sensor readings; allow schedule override
- Success signal: "I can check my plants from my phone and it feels like magic"

## Prioritized Learning Path

| Hypothesis | Impact | Confidence | Go/No-Go |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| #1 (No-solder breadboard) | High (removes activation barrier) | High | **GO** |
| #2 (Python logic) | High (leverages strength) | High | **GO** |
| #3 (Offline resilience) | Medium (nice-to-have; not critical) | High | **GO** |
| #4 (Dashboard magic) | Medium (Phase 2; can skip) | Medium | **GO** (optional) |
